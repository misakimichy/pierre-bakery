#### _C# Console Application: Pan Bakery 12/13/2019_

## Description
Create a C# console application for a bakery.

## Application should have:
- There should be __two classes__: one for `Bread` and one for `Pastry`.

- When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both `Bread` and `Pastry`.

- A user should be able to specify how many loaves of `Bread` and how many `Pastry`s they'd like.

- The application will return the total cost of the order.

- The bakery offers a special deal:

    - `Bread`: Buy 2, get 1 free.
    - `Pastry`: Buy 2, get 1 half price.
